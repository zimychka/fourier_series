Fourier Series Visualization 🎵📈
This project is a Python-based visualization of Fourier series — a powerful mathematical tool for approximating periodic functions using sums of sine and cosine waves.

📌 About the Project
Using numpy and matplotlib, this project demonstrates how complex periodic signals can be broken down and reconstructed from simple trigonometric components. It's both a mathematical and visual exploration aimed at improving intuition around Fourier series.

Whether you're a student learning signal processing or just curious about the beauty of math and code — this project offers an interactive and insightful way to understand how Fourier series work.
